Here's what each selection means:

**1) TypeScript:** Choose Yes (default JavaScript, simpler if youâ€™re unfamiliar with TypeScript).

**2) ESLint:** Choose Yes (helps maintain code quality).

**3) Tailwind CSS:** Choose Yes (recommended styling framework).

**4) src/ directory:** Choose Yes (organized file structure, recommended).

**5) App Router:** Choose Yes (modern Next.js routing, recommended).

**6) Turbopack:** Choose Yes (faster builds and better performance).

**7) Customize import alias:** Write @/* (custom shortcut paths for cleaner imports).

**NOTE**: If you want to terminate it press Ctrl + C in your terminal to stop the Next.js dev server.

Now it is running successfully. 

Go to **http://localhost:3000/** to verify.

I think it is 100% good now!
The fact that I see this screen means:

1) Next.js is running perfectly.
2) My development server is live at http://localhost:3000
3) The terminal is supposed to keep running â€” it's not supposed to "end" like other one-time commands. It keeps running to:

Watch for changes

Auto-reload the browser when you update your code

## Ticket 2: Define Folder Structure & Static Data

**mkdir -p src/data**
